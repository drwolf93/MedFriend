# MedFriend - Win The 4th place for the most Innovative Idea

This project was done in collaboration with 2 fellow students from University of Medicine and Pharmacy Iuliu Hatieganu in Dec 2017 during an innovation program for medical students. 
My team (3) came up with a solution, MedFriend, for the unmet medical need found in our community by taking interviews to people and sending questionnaires (100 people). 
People interviewed and those that answered to our questionnaire were frustrated because every medical diagnostic that they had was not explained in details by a doctor. 
We created MedFriend, a platform where patients can upload their medical data and get an easy to read diagnostic. We don't give people treatments and diagnostics, we just help them understand what they have and we give them suggestions on doctors they can contact if they have further questions.
